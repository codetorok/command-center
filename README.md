  <p>The way it works is that you use your browser's search function to quickly find commands for a tool you need. In Firefox for example this is done by using <code>CTRL+F</code></p>
  <p>Let's try it! Let's use the search phrase "click". Hit <code>CTRL+F</code> and then type in the search bar <code>click</code></p>
  <p>Alternatively you can just browse through these commands using your slider in your browser or your mouse wheel in the middle.</p>
