<h1>Welcome to the Command Center!</h1>

<p>There are so many tools and commands and switches! I made this repo so you can quickly search for the right ones when needed.</p>
<p>Leave the outside world and step into my cyber space</p>

<p>The way it works is that you use your browser's search function to quickly find commands for a tool you need. In Firefox for example this is done by using <code>CTRL+F</code></p>

<p>Or you can just walk through the commands hence they are ordered in alphabetical order.</p>
