### What is AD?

* Directory service developed by Microsoft Windows to manage Windows domain networks.

#### What does it do?

* Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers, etc.

#### How does it work?

* Authenticates using Kerberos tickets.
* **Non-Windows** devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP.

#### Why to learn AD?

* AD is the most commonly used identity management system in the world!
* **It can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits. Instead abuse features, trusts, components and more.

### Components:

* allows administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources
